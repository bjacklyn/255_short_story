## Abstract

In recent years, much of the research on clustering algorithms has primarily focused on enhancing their accuracy and
efficiency, frequently at the expense of interpretability. However, as these methods are increasingly being applied in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, the need for transparent and interpretable clustering outcomes has
become a critical concern. This is not only necessary for gaining user trust but also for satisfying the growing ethical and regulatory
demands in these fields. Ensuring that decisions derived from clustering algorithms can be clearly understood and justified is now a
fundamental requirement. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured review of the current state of
explainable clustering algorithms, identifying key criteria to distinguish between various methods. These insights can effectively assist
researchers in making informed decisions about the most suitable explainable clustering methods for specific application contexts,
while also promoting the development and adoption of clustering algorithms that are both efficient and transparent.
